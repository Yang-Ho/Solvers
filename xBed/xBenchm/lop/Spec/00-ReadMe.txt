Files in this directory have been downloaded from
http://www.optsicom.es/lolib/

For compatibility with xBed conventions, the name of each file 
is slightly modified without loosing the original context of the name.

For example, under the directory lop/Spec/:

N-pal11  —> pal-11
…
N-atp111 —> atp-111
N-atp24  —> atp-024

N-EX1    —> ex—50-1
N-EX1    —> ex—50-2
etc.

Under xBed convention, the second substring that follows '-' is interpreted 
as the original dimension of the instance coordinate — before any reductions 
due to instance symmetries, etc.

Thus: 

pal-11    implies a permutation coordinate of length  11
atp-111   implies a permutation coordinate of length 111
atp-024   implies a permutation coordinate of length  24
ex—50-1   implies a permutation coordinate of length  50
ex—50-2   implies a permutation coordinate of length  50
etc.
